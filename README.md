## One Stop Shop is a hackathon project, serving New Yorkers by connecting users to resource centers to receive social service benefits under one roof


## Background
It’s no secret that New York City doesn’t make it easy for people to get access to resources they need, especially if they fall in the low income bracket. 


## What's the Problem?

1. There are thousands of programs in New York City but no clear concise way to easily access them

2. The average person has to make multiple trips to different government offices to obtain different services



## One Stop Shop IS the solution

- Collections of Resource Centers can help provide SNAP, Medicaid and housing assistance 
- Users can filter for resource centers by Borough 
- Details about each center includes automatic phone dialing and directions to the sites
- User is able to save any number of resource centers to their favorites to refer back to at any time
